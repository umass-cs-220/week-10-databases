# Week 10: Data Patterns

## Overview

This week we will covering relational databases and structure query
language (SQL). We have seen how to organize data in memory using
classes and pattern matching over that data in code. We have also
looked at how to store and manipulate data in CSV files. As
applications grow in size they need to depend on other ways of
managing that data. In particular, we will look at how to store and
query data in relational databases. We will interact with a database
using the structure query language to create tables for holding data
and writing queries in SQL to store and retrieve data contained in a
database. In addition, we will investigate how to write programs that
interact with a database using a database library.
